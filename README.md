# parturit

An exploration into the hairdresser density in Finland. 

## Background

I wanted to try [Clerk notebooks](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk
"Clerk notebooks") and during my summer holiday a test subject presented itself.

## Examples

Take a look at a static rendering [here](https://jhimanka.github.io/parturit/)

### Thanks

Thanks to [Statistics Finland](https://www.stat.fi/index_en.html), especially Hans Baumgartner for advice
and encouragement.
